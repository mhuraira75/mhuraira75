# Muhammad Huraira — SOC Analyst (Detection Engineering & Investigation Focus)

I build hands-on Security Operations Center (SOC) capability through a structured, documentation-first home lab designed to simulate real-world SOC workflows.

My focus is not just tool deployment, but operating like a SOC analyst — building behaviour-based detections, validating telemetry, performing investigations, and producing portfolio-level security documentation.

---

## Current Focus

- Behaviour-based detection engineering
- SOC analyst investigation workflows
- Endpoint telemetry analysis (Sysmon + SIEM correlation)
- Alert triage and evidence-driven incident classification
- Detection tuning and false-positive reduction

---

## Primary Project

### SOC Home Lab — Wazuh SIEM (Detection Engineering & Investigation Workflow)

A production-style SOC environment designed to replicate real monitoring and investigation processes.

---

### Architecture

- Wazuh SIEM deployed on Ubuntu Server (Manager / Indexer / Dashboard)
- Windows 11 endpoint onboarded with Wazuh agent
- Sysmon deployed for enriched endpoint telemetry
- Secure CLI-based administration and operational validation

---

### Detection Engineering Work

- Behaviour-based PowerShell detections
- Encoded command detection
- Persistence and privilege escalation monitoring
- Credential access detection
- Discovery and defense evasion behaviour analysis
- Lateral movement visibility
- LOLBins detection (certutil, PowerShell chaining)
- Parent-child process analysis
- Behaviour chaining and multi-stage attack modelling

---

### SOC Investigation Workflow (Portfolio Work)

Performed full end-to-end SOC investigation using real telemetry:

- Alert queue triage
- Timeline reconstruction
- Process lineage analysis
- Behaviour chain investigation
- Artifact validation (hashing, content analysis)
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Risk classification (benign vs suspicious vs malicious)
- Detection improvement and tuning recommendations

All investigation reports and supporting documentation are maintained in this repository.

## Skills

### SIEM & SOC Operations

- Wazuh SIEM deployment and administration
- Alert validation and backend log analysis
- SOC investigation workflow simulation
- Detection engineering aligned with MITRE ATT&CK

### Endpoint Monitoring

- Windows Security Event Logs
- Sysmon telemetry analysis
- Process execution and behaviour analysis
- File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)

### Linux & Infrastructure

- Ubuntu Server (CLI-focused administration)
- SSH-based secure management
- Service monitoring and log inspection

### Operational Practices

- Documentation-first security workflow
- Evidence-driven investigation methodology
- Backend telemetry validation (JSON parsing, filtering)
- Analyst-focused reporting and portfolio building

---

## Current Direction

I am now expanding into **hybrid detection engineering** by integrating endpoint telemetry with network-level visibility.

Next phase focus:

- Network SOC monitoring
- Endpoint + network correlation detections
- Network telemetry analysis
- Threat hunting across multiple data sources
