# Muhammad Huraira — SOC Analyst (Entry-Level)

I am building hands-on Security Operations Center (SOC) skills through a structured, documentation-first home lab that mirrors real-world SOC workflows. My focus is on endpoint telemetry, SIEM operations, alert validation, and investigation readiness rather than tool installation alone.

---

## Current Focus
- SOC operations and analyst workflows  
- Endpoint telemetry enrichment and validation  
- Detection visibility and alert investigation

## Projects

### SOC Home Lab – Wazuh SIEM
A SOC-style home lab designed to simulate real-world monitoring and investigation workflows.

**Key work completed:**
- Deployed and validated a Wazuh SIEM on Ubuntu Server (CLI-only)
- Implemented secure SSH-based administration and access separation
- Onboarded a Windows 11 endpoint with Wazuh agent
- Configured and tested File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)
- Deployed Sysmon to enrich Windows endpoint telemetry
- Verified Sysmon ingestion at endpoint, SIEM backend, and dashboard levels
- Created analyst-friendly dashboard views for high-value telemetry
- Maintained detailed documentation and validation evidence in GitHub
